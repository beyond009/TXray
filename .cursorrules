# Mevagent Project Rules

## Language
- Use **English only** for code, comments, documentation, commit messages, and UI strings.

## Comments
- **Avoid comments** unless the logic is genuinely complex.
- Add comments **only when**:
  - Non-obvious algorithms (e.g. BigInt handling, encoding edge cases)
  - Security or correctness considerations that are not clear from the code
  - External API quirks or workarounds that need explanation
- Prefer clear naming and small functions over explanatory comments.
- Do **not** comment obvious code, routine setup, or trivial logic.
